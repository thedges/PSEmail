Here are steps to setup and configure this component:

    - Click __Edit__ button, fined the __.pdf__ entry and change to __Execute In Browser__
  * Install the component per the "Deploy to Salesforce" button below. 
    - If installing the quick action (see above), add the quick action to your record page layout. Provided with this package is a Quick Action named "PSContentRecordAction" that you can use to test out and place on any record page.
    - Else you can drag the PSContentRecord Lightning Component on a record page...on the main page, in a tab, etc... This component wants a wide amount of screen area so quick action may be best choice.
  * If you are using the component directly on a page, configure the component properties: Height, Columns, EditFields, Content Parent Field
  * That is it...now use either the Quick Action or Lightning Component depending on your choice of setup.
